# Weather-derivatives-Pricing
Data used can be found in the excel files. The first part of the code labelled "dataset" serves the function of cleaning the data from the weather station of "Milan v. Brera" to make it readable to the second part of the program which is the "final(1)". In "final(1)" we model temperature data with a truncated Fourier series. Then we use a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stpchastic process for the pricing of a temperature option. Given the incompleteness of the weather derivatives market and its illiquidity we employ the Girsanov theorem to change the measure from P to Q under Brownian dynamics. These features prompted for option price estimation by means of the Monte-Carlo method by simulating a number of possible paths. For each simulated path the option's payoff functionis computed, the resulting payoffs are then averaged to obtain an estimate of the expected payoff at maturity. We then obtain an estimation call, put and strangle price.
